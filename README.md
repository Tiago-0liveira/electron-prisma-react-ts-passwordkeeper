# Password-Keeper
## | Pros:

	- Store your loggin credentials 
	- No need to remember all the different and complex passwords
	- Do not care if the password is random just store it! 
	- Switch Steam accounts faster than ever

## | Build it yourself!

I Recommend using `yarn` wich is the package manager i used. 

To create a new build just run `yarn package:dist`

## | Debugging/Developing

While developing the app run `wt-setup.cmd`, it uses the Windows Terminal to open 4 terminals in the same page, one for electron, one for react, one for sqlite3 and the other is for general purpose.
Everytime a change is made in the electron part you have to restart the electron terminal. In the other hand react will detect changes automatically and auto-update! (just press Ctrl+r)
